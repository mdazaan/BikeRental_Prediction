# BikeRental_Prediction
I have attached the code in bikerental.r
you can run it in R studio or in Kaggle.
My methodology is simple, 
1. I have installed the Libraries, then i have imported the csv file i.e dataset.
2. Then, I Renamed the columns for a better understanding of variables and  converted the datatypes of the datetime and numerical attributes to category.
3. Analyzed the missing values in dataset.
4. Plotted monthly distribution of the total number of bikes rented.
5. Violin plot for Yearly wise distribution of counts.
6. box-plotted for outliers' analysis.
7. Split the dataset into train and test datasets loaded the purrr library for functions and vectors.
8. Then I applied the Random Forest Model.



I have attached my outputs in Bike Rental Prediction using R.pptx

I have attached the Output data i.e. Predicted data vs Test data in Bike_RentingOutput.CSV
